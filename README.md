The proposed method integrates Procedural Level Generation and Procedural Content Generation in a rudimentary FPS game that allows for the generation of a singular level with varied content. 
The series first generates a high-level layout of the level using PLG, which is then passed through a series of prefabricated(“prefabs”) modules that apply different PCG techniques to generate varied content for each area of the level.
